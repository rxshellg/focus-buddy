# 🍅 FocusBuddy

**FocusBuddy** is a modern, themeable Pomodoro timer built with **Vite + React**.  
It helps you stay productive using the **Pomodoro technique** — short work intervals paired with breaks — but with a fun twist: customizable backgrounds and mascots (like a tomato, burger, or orange) that keep you company while you work.
